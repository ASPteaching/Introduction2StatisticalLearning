# Course Objectives

1 - **Understand the Statistical/Machine Learning approach** and how it relates with traditional Statistical Modelling.

2 - **Develop understanding of key Learning methods**, including:

-   Building and tuning models\
-   Appropriate application of models using relevant software tools\
-   Interpreting results and recognizing limitations

3 - **Adapt to Rapid Field Advancements**, staying informed about the fast-paced developments in the field and learn to manage and integrate new advancements.

# Methodology

- Teaching language is Spanish. Materials in English.

- Main concepts will be presented in class based on slides/blackboard.
  - Materials in Atenea and/or github

- Practical applications will be demonstrated/followed using notebooks provided in campus.
  - Will try to use both R and Python
  - You are expected to be able to re-run and understand them.
  
- Exercises for practice will be  provided and their solution will be either discussed in class or provided.

- Student participation is encouraged, either by presenting their work in class and/or contributing to the forum.

# Timing

- Part 1. Alex. From 02/05/2025 till 03/26/2025
  
  - Introduction
  - Tree based methods
  - Neural networks
  
- Part 2. Pedro. From 03/31/2025 till 05/14/2025

  - Penalized regression methods
  - Non parametric regression

# Evaluation & Grading

- As indicated in the course guide

- Each part of the course: 50%.

- For each part:
  
  - A final examen is done with weight of 50%
  - Remaining 50% is the average of scoring of submitted tasks.
- In the age of ChatGPT checking individual work is hard so there will also be on-class quizzes and oral verification of submitted work.
