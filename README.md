# Introduction to Statistical Learning

This github repository[^1] is intended to provide materials (slides, scripts datasets etc) for the 2nd part of the Statistical Learning course at the UPC-UBMSc in Sttaistics and Operations Research (MESIO).

[^1] A previous version of this repository can be found at [https://github.com/ASPteaching/introstatlearning](https://github.com/ASPteaching/introstatlearning), but I have decided to re-create it because the repository had become to heavy due to caches and git savings that I don't know how to clean.

The (second part of the course) has two blocks, each with two parts.

1. Tree based methods
  1.1 Decision trees
  1.2 Ensemble methods
2. Artificial neural networks
  2.1 Artificial neural networks
  2.2 Introduction to deep learning
